This project is created with Python and the use of NEAT, a module that supports implementation of NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) into my project.

To use it, download the main folder and run "main_game.py". A display screen will come up, demonstrating how the neural network improves as it plays the game repeatedly. Information on each generation will be displayed in the terminal window.

Additional features, such as yielding the results as well as extracting data from the well-performing networks into a data file is soon to be updated.
Thank you for your support!
